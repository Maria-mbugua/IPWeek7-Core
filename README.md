# SALES_PREDICTION
# a) Specifying the Question
You have been tasked to study the factors that affect housing prices using the given information on real estate properties that was collected over the past few months. Later onwards, create a model that would allow the company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables.


# b) Defining the Metrics of Success
Creating a model to accurately make predictions of the sale of the housing prices.


# c) Understanding the Context
Getting to know the factors that affect the housing sale prices is essential for any real estate company. Providing an observation and recommendation on the suitability of each of the tested models on their validity of solving the problem.


# d) Recording the Experimental Design
1. Define the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design taken.

2. Read and explore the dataset.

3. Define the validity of the available data to answer the given question.

4. Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.

5. Perform univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis and record the observations.

6. Performing regression analysis.

7. Provide a recommendation based on the analysis.

8. Challenge the solution by providing insights on how you can make improvements in model improvement.


# e) Relevance of the Data
The dataset used in this project is necessary for the understanding of the real estate complexities and the factors which later determine the outcome of the project.
